        Inform the plotter of the diameter of a swivelling tool's working

        Tool diameters for the standard tools supplied with the current device

        .. note::
        
            Cutting blade cartridges contain a blade on a swivelling

            .. image:: _static/tool_diameter.svg
                :alt: A story-board showing a corner being cut in four steps.
                      Step 1-2: The knife reaches the corner. Step 2-3: The
                      plotter moves the knife such that the point stays
                      stationary but is now pointing along the next edge. Step
                      3-4: The next edge is cut.
            
            As such, the point of the blade's position will lag behind the
            plotter's position. Setting this parameter causes the device's
            firmware to compensate for this automatically when turning corners
            by moving the plotter in an arc pattern towards the new line.
            During this move, the blade turns to face the new cut direction but
            does not actually cut.
            
            When using a tool with a swivelling cutting implement (such as the
            included knife cartridge), setting this parameter correctly is
            strongly recommended for good results. If using a fixed implement
            (e.g. a pen), this setting should usually be set to 0.0 since the
            pen tip is fixed.

        :py:exc:`RegistrationMarkNotFoundError` is raised.
        
        This command will block until the registration marks have been found or
        not.

            As a side effect of calling this command, the tool speed will be
            set to its maximum.
        
        .. note::
        
            Registration marks should look as follows (without the red
            construction/dimension lines...):
            
            .. image:: _static/regmarks.svg
                :alt: The registration marks consist of a 5x5mm square at the top
                      left of the page, a 20mm 'L' bracket at the bottom left and
                      corresponding bracket at the top right.
            
            * The registration marks must be oriented as shown and white space must
              be left around all three marks to ensure they are found by the
              plotter.
            
            * The entire path to be plotted/cut must be within the bounds of the
              registration marks.
            
            * The top-left mark should be near the top-left of the page so
              that the plotter can find.
            
            * The width and height are measured from the *outside* of the
              corner bracket lines.
            
            Most Silhouette plotters also support a second type of registration
            mark where the top-left square is replaced with another corner
            bracket. Use of this type of registration mark is not supported by
            this library.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        width, height: float
            The size of the area the registration mark covers in mm.
            
            .. warning::
                
                Take care that the right-most registration mark is not too
                close to the right-hand extreme of the machine. The
                registration sensor is mounted at the very left side of the
                carriage so it will need to move further than it would when
                plotting on that corner of the page. The plotter does not have
                a 'right' end-stop and may hit the end of its axis.
        
        box_size : float
            The size of the black square in the top-left registration mark
            (mm). Currently must be set to 5mm (the default).
        line_thickness : float
            The thickness of the registration lines (mm). Default of 0.5 mm
            is known to work well.
        line_length : float
            The length the registration lines (mm). Default of 20 mm
            is known to work well.
        search : bool
            If true, the device will start searching for the registration mark
            automatically, starting at the device home position. If False the
            device should first be positioned with the tool over the black
            square. In practice this is very difficult to achieve so most users
            will want to leave this setting in its default mode (True).
